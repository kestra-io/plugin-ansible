# How to use the Ansible plugin

Run Ansible playbooks and ad-hoc commands from Kestra flows inside a container with the Ansible CLI pre-installed.

## Common properties

`containerImage` defaults to `cytopia/ansible:latest-tools`. `taskRunner` controls where the container runs — defaults to Docker. Pass inventory files, playbooks, and other supporting files via `inputFiles` (inline content) or pull them from [namespace files](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/namespace-files). Target host credentials (SSH keys, passwords) are supplied through the inventory file using standard Ansible inventory variables rather than plugin-level properties.

## Tasks

`cli.AnsibleCLI` runs one or more Ansible CLI commands set in `commands` (e.g. `ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.ini`). Use `beforeCommands` to run setup steps before the main commands, `env` to inject environment variables, and `outputFiles` to capture files produced during execution. Set `ansibleConfig` to supply a custom `ansible.cfg`; if omitted, Kestra generates one automatically with its structured output callback enabled.
