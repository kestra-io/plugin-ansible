description: "Tasks that run Ansible CLI commands to execute playbooks and capture results."
body: "Provide commands (required) and any playbooks or inventories via inputFiles or Namespace Files; tasks run in a container image (default cytopia/ansible:latest-tools) with optional beforeCommands and env to prepare the environment. A default ansible.cfg and callback plugin are injected so playbook outputs, per-task details, and logs (when outputLogFile is true) are returned to Kestra."
